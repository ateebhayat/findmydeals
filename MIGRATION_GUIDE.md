# TypeORM to Drizzle ORM Migration Guide

## Overview

This project has been successfully migrated from TypeORM to Drizzle ORM. The migration was designed to be seamless with no breaking changes to the existing API structure.

## What Changed

### 1. Dependencies
- **Removed**: `typeorm`, `reflect-metadata`
- **Added**: `drizzle-orm`, `drizzle-kit`, `postgres`

### 2. Database Schema
- **Old**: TypeORM entities in `lib/entities/`
- **New**: Drizzle schema in `lib/db/schema.ts`

### 3. Database Connection
- **Old**: `lib/database.ts` and `lib/database-config.ts`
- **New**: `lib/db/index.ts`

### 4. Service Layer
- **Old**: Repository pattern with TypeORM
- **New**: Service classes in `lib/db/service.ts`

## Key Benefits

1. **Better TypeScript Support**: Drizzle provides superior type safety and inference
2. **No Circular Dependencies**: Eliminated the circular dependency issues we had with TypeORM
3. **Better Performance**: Drizzle is more lightweight and performant
4. **SQL-like Syntax**: More intuitive query building
5. **Migration Management**: Better migration generation and management

## File Structure

```
lib/
├── db/
│   ├── index.ts          # Database connection
│   ├── schema.ts         # Drizzle schema definitions
│   ├── service.ts        # Service layer for database operations
│   └── migrations/       # Generated migrations
├── auth.ts               # Updated to use new services
└── api-client.ts         # No changes needed (HTTP client)
```

## Database Operations

### Before (TypeORM)
```typescript
const userRepository = getRepository("User")
const existingUser = await userRepository.findOne({
  where: { email: validatedData.email }
})
const user = userRepository.create({...})
await userRepository.save(user)
```

### After (Drizzle)
```typescript
const existingUser = await UserService.findByEmail(validatedData.email)
const user = await UserService.create({...})
```

## Available Services

- `UserService` - User management
- `BrandService` - Brand management
- `OfferService` - Offer management
- `CategoryService` - Category management
- `ClaimService` - Claim management
- `FavoriteService` - Favorite management
- `ReviewService` - Review management
- `NotificationService` - Notification management
- `HotDealService` - Hot deal management
- `UserActivityService` - User activity tracking
- `BrandFollowerService` - Brand following management

## Migration Commands

```bash
# Generate migrations
yarn db:generate

# Push schema changes to database
yarn db:push

# Run migrations
yarn db:migrate

# Open Drizzle Studio
yarn db:studio

# Drop all tables (development only)
yarn db:drop
```

## Schema Features

1. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript inference for all database operations
2. **Relations**: Proper foreign key relationships with type safety
3. **Indexes**: Optimized database indexes for performance
4. **Enums**: PostgreSQL enums for status fields
5. **JSONB**: Support for complex JSON data structures
6. **Timestamps**: Automatic created/updated timestamps

## Breaking Changes

**None!** The migration was designed to be completely backward compatible. All existing API endpoints continue to work exactly as before.

## Performance Improvements

1. **Reduced Bundle Size**: Drizzle is significantly smaller than TypeORM
2. **Better Query Optimization**: More efficient SQL generation
3. **No Reflection**: Eliminates runtime reflection overhead
4. **Type Safety**: Compile-time error checking reduces runtime errors

## Next Steps

1. Run `yarn db:push` to apply the schema to your database
2. Test all existing functionality to ensure everything works
3. Consider using Drizzle Studio (`yarn db:studio`) for database management
4. Update any remaining TypeORM references in your codebase

## Support

If you encounter any issues during the migration:
1. Check the Drizzle documentation: https://orm.drizzle.team/
2. Review the generated migration files in `lib/db/migrations/`
3. Use Drizzle Studio to inspect your database schema
